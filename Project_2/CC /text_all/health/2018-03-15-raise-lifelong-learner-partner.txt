How to encourage your children's passion for learning
"Look! When I mix these paints, I get a whole new color!" Hearing your kids get excited about learning feels like glitter bombs exploding in your heart. And it's confirmation that school and report cards are really only one sign that your kids are learning. While grades and test scores are important, what about the sparkle in their eyes when they discover a "new" bug in the backyard, see a painting that inspires some art of their own, and overcome frustration to go hand-over-hand across the monkey bars? In the end we want their love of learning to go beyond school and sustain them throughout their whole lives.
