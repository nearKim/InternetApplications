ABC had said that the finale would "rock "'Bachelor Nation' to its core," and they were right.  Luyendyk Jr. picked Becca Kufrin to be his bride.  But during the "After the Final Rose" episode immediately following the finale, Luyendyk Jr. revealed they are no longer together. Not only did he call things off with Kufrin, but in an unprecedented move, he rekindled his romance with runner-up Lauren Burnham.  During the "After the Final Rose" ceremony, Kufrin called the emotional and tearful breakup "brutal." Due to time constraints ABC revealed that there will be a two-part "After the Final Rose" which will feature Luyendyk and Burnham. In the days leading up to the dramatic finale there were rumblings that Luyendyk Jr. had a change of heart after his proposal.  In a recent interview with E!, he said he hopes viewers will "understand me a lot more" after they get over the initial unexpectedness of his decision.  "This is my journey, and this is about finding a lasting love and that road is not always the easiest," he said. "It's all about the ending and finding that person for yourself and that's the important part. I'm very happy."
