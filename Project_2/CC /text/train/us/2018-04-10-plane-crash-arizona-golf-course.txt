6 dead in small plane crash at Arizona golf course 
A small plane crashed at a central Arizona golf course shortly after takeoff from a nearby airport Monday night, leaving six people dead, officials said. The plane departed Scottsdale Airport and crashed soon afterward at the TPC Scottsdale Champions Course, just north of the airport, the Scottsdale Police Department said.  Video from CNN affiliate KXNV showed fiery wreckage on the golf course. The Piper PA-24-260 took off around 8:45 p.m. was supposed to fly to Nevada's North Las Vegas Airport in what should have been a roughly 75-minute flight, said Eliott Simpson, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. None of the six people aboard the aircraft survived, Simpson said. Their names were not immediately released.  The NTSB is investigating the cause -- a probe that could take up to 18 months, Simpson said. The TPC Scottsdale is one of a string of Tournament Players Clubs licensed by the PGA Tour. The tour's Phoenix Open is held annually at TPC Scottsdale's Stadium Course, near the Champions Course.
