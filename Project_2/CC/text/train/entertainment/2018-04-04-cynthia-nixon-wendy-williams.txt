"People talk a lot to me about being a celebrity entering this race," she said. "But I have to say when Andrew Cuomo ran eight years ago he was a celebrity because he was the son of Mario Cuomo." Nixon hinted as to why she chose Williams to talk to as the pair discussed the candidate's need for support among African-American women. "They are the cornerstone, the backbone of the Democratic Party," Nixon said. "We need to let them lead." She also talked about some of her political views, including the legalization of marijuana, her support of the Black Lives Matter movement and gun control.  "We have good gun laws here, but we just passed a budget ... we did almost nothing to amend our gun laws," Nixon said. "We have such an appetite now, that's why I'm running. There's such an appetite for real progressive change in New York state."
