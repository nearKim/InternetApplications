The hip hop star was arrested last year after he was involved in a fight, then arrested again for popping wheelies on a dirt bike.

Now we can celebrate his release. We thank every individual that has supported and fought alongside Meek every step of the way." "They made you a political prisoner to silence you... you stood tall and stayed SOLID," T.I. wrote in a caption of a video of his phone conversation with Mill on Instagram. "They can't stop you now lil bro!!!! It's almost OVER!!!" (Warning: The video contains language NSFW.) Fellow Philadelphia native actor Kevin Hart announced news of the release on Instagram with a photo of himself, Mill and Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin, who had also been a vocal supporter of the rapper. "Meek Mill is Frrrrreeeeeeeee ....I just left from seeing him in jail with @michaelgrubin and we were just told that he is being released," Hart wrote in the caption of a photo showing the trio courtside at a 76ers game. "Woooooooow......Stand Up Philadelphia!!!!!" Mill attended Tuesday night's game against the Miami Heat, and Hart shared a photo of him and the rapper at the game.
