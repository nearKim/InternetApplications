Shania Twain apologizes after saying she would have voted for Trump
Singer Shania Twain has apologized for saying she would have backed Donald Trump if she had been eligible to vote in the 2016 US presidential election.The Canadian said on Twitter that she did not "hold any common moral beliefs" with Trump and regretted appearing to endorse him in an interview with the Guardian that was published Sunday. "I would have voted for him because, even though he was offensive, he seemed honest," the newspaper quoted her as saying. "Do you want straight or polite? Not that you shouldn't be able to have both. If I were voting, I just don't want bulls**t. I would have voted for a feeling that it was transparent. And politics has a reputation of not being that, right?" Twain said. But late Sunday the country star tweeted a four-part apology. "I would like to apologise to anybody I have offended in a recent interview with the Guardian relating to the American President. The question caught me off guard. As a Canadian, I regret answering this unexpected question without giving my response more context ," Twain said. "I am passionately against discrimination of any kind and hope it's clear from the choices I have made, and the people I stand with, that I do not hold any common moral beliefs with the current President. "I was trying to explain, in response to a question about the election, that my limited understanding was that the President talked to a portion of America like an accessible person they could relate to, as he was NOT a politician." "My answer was awkward, but certainly should not be taken as representative of my values nor does it mean I endorse him. I make music to bring people together. My path will always be one of inclusivity, as my history shows."
