Final Parkland shooting survivor released from the hospital
Anthony Borges, the last patient from the February 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, has been released from the hospital, according to his attorney.Anthony, 15, was shot five times while protecting his classmates from the gunman on the day of the shooting. He had barricaded a door with his body and was shot through the door. A third of his lung had to be removed, one bullet came close to his liver, and three bullets hit his legs in the shooting that killed 17 people, NBC's "Today" show reported Wednesday morning. Wearing an FC Barcelona jersey, Anthony spoke haltingly to "Today" due to his injuries. "I feel good," he said. "I (thought) I was going to die." Alex Arreaza, his attorney, said last month the family planned to sue Broward County, Broward County Public Schools and the Broward County Sheriff's Office. "The failure of Broward County Public Schools, and of the Principal and School Resource Officer to adequately protect students, and in particular our client, from life-threatening harm were unreasonable, callous and negligent," Arreaza wrote in a notice of intent to sue.
