207 million eggs in nine states recalled over salmonella fears 
A farm in Indiana is recalling more than 200 million eggs sold in nine states over salmonella fears.  Rose Acre Farms voluntarily recalled 206,749,248 eggs due to potential contamination with Salmonella Braenderup, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.  At least 22 illnesses have been reported so far, the FDA said Friday.  The eggs were sold through retail stores and restaurants. They reached consumers in Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. "Consumers with these eggs shouldn't eat them," FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted.  "Throw them away or return them to place of purchase for credit or refund." Brands affected include Country Daybreak, Coburn Farms, Crystal Farms, Sunshine Farms and Glenview, with some eggs sold at Food Lion stores.  Salmonella causes serious and sometimes fatal infections, especially in young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.  It is generally contracted from contaminated poultry, meat, eggs and water, and affects the intestinal tract.  Chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces.  Alternatively, bacteria in the hen's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service.  Symptoms include fever, nausea, diarrhea and abdominal pain.  In 2010, a salmonella outbreak sickened hundreds and led to the recall of half a billion eggs.
