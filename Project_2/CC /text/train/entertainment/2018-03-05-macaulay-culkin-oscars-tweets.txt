Macaulay Culkin's epic Oscars live-tweeting
Macaulay Culkin says he didn't watch the Oscars, but that didn't stop him from live-tweeting the event.The actor offered pictures of activities he was doing instead of watching the Academy Awards such as cooking ramen and playing the guitar, while wearing a tux. He also posted some tongue-in-cheek predictions and puns. Culkin took some swipes at a few men in Hollywood who have been accused of sexual misconduct. "EXCLUSIVE: I heard Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein were going to come disguised as a very tall man in a long trench coat but they got busted by security," Culkin tweeted. Culkin even slid in a sports joke. "Actually, the best original score of the year was New England 33 - Philadelphia 41," he tweeted, referencing this year's Super Bowl. The "Home Alone" star also joked about being left out of the "In Memoriam" video tribute -- a nod to rumors of his demise which have floated over the years. Culkin's tweet storm was unusual for the typically under-the-radar celebrity. "RT if you didn't know Macaulay Culkin was still alive until that fire Oscars tweet," USA Today's Kyle Madson tweeted.
