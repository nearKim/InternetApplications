Cardi B's baby gift from Jimmy Fallon 
Is Cardi B having a baby girl? That's what Jimmy Fallon's gift to her is leading some to believe.  The rapper co-hosted Monday's "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" and received a few baby gifts. She posted a video on Instagram showing a gift basket that Fallon gave her. "This is the first baby gift I have gotten from Jimmy Fallon," Cardi B said before pulling out a pint-size leopard print coat that looked very much like one she has been photographed in. "This is so cute!" The basket also contained a blinged-out baby bottle, a purple blanket similar to one the rapper carries, Fallon's book "Everything Is Mama," and a teddy bear wearing a T-shirt inscribed with the title of a Cardi B song, "Washpoppin." Stand-up comic and "Saturday Night Live" writer John Mulaney, a guest on the show, also presented her with a gift from him and his wife -- a baby cardigan that he renamed "a Cardi G." "Oh my God this feels weird," the rapper said. "Babies are so little."  The 25-year-old star revealed her pregnancy over the weekend on "SNL" and said she has been grateful for all the support she's received.
