"I'm so excited to be returning to Discovery to work with these kids on a new incarnation of the show I love so much," Savage said in a statement. "To be able to confront them with great questions and the resources to answer them is such a dream. Helping to inspire future scientists and engineers is a mission I share with Discovery." Savage and Jamie Hyneman co-hosted the original "MythBusters," which debuted on Discovery Channel in 2003 and achieved almost cult-like status among fans. That show ended its 14-year run on the network in 2016.
