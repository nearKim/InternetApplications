Barbara Bush in great spirits and feisty, source says
Former first lady Barbara Bush remains feisty and in great spirits, a source close with the Bush family said Monday. CNN reported Sunday that the 92-year-old is in failing health and is being cared for in her Houston home and is with her husband, former President George H.W. Bush. Bush's office confirmed in a statement a "recent series of hospitalizations" for Bush and her decision to seek "comfort care" instead of additional medical help. Following the reports of her condition, many politicians shared memories of and prayers and well wishes for Bush across social media, including Hillary Clinton, who on Monday said she was "thinking about Barbara Bush's legacy of service to our country and the extraordinary family she raised." The Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy established a page on its website for people to send their well wishes to the former first lady. Along with her husband, Bush has been accompanied by her daughter Doro and sons Marvin and Neil. Her other sons, former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have been in and out visiting her the past week.
