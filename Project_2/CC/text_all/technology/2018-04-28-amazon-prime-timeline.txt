Everything Amazon has added to Prime over the years
Prime has been a big hit for Amazon. The membership service -- which gives users access to free two-day shipping, music, movies and other perks -- has over 100 million subscribers. On Thursday, the tech giant announced it's hiking the annual price of Prime to $119 from $99.
